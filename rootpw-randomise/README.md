# A package to randomise the root password on MacOS

This is intended to implement the workaround for the High Sierra root login bug.

We set the root password to a long random string, and attempt to do so safely in a way which minimises the likelihood of the password bein displayed anywhere.

## How to use it
To build a package:

```sh ./build.sh```

Use entirely at your own risk.
